    <content type="text"><![CDATA[One of our central themes is that if assets are priced rationally,variables that are related to average returns, such as size and book-to-market equity, must proxy for sensitivity to common (shared and thus undiversifiable) risk factors in returns. In such regressions, a well-specified asset-pricing model produces intercepts that are indistinguishable from 0 [Merton (1973)]. The estimated intercepts provide a simple return metric and a formal test of how well different combinations of the common factors capture the cross section of average returns. —— Fama and French (1993)]]></content>
